# WildFire-Predictor-Using-GPT 3

This project involves building a bot that predicts the likelihood of a wildfire based on flame sensors, temperature, and humidity data using OpenAI's GPT-3 architecture. The bot takes in data as input and generates a prediction based on the input. The prediction generated is one of three categories: High, Medium, or Low, and the bot provides a recommendation for action based on the prediction.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites

To use this project, you need to have Python 3 installed on your system. You also need an OpenAI API key. You can get an API key by signing up for OpenAI at https://beta.openai.com/signup/.

### Installing

Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/<username>/WildFire-Predictor-Using-GPT-3.git
```
### Usage

Enter the location for which you want to predict the likelihood of a wildfire.

```
location_var = input("Enter the location of the wildfire prediction: ")
```
Call the `predict_wildfire()` function by providing the flame sensors, temperature, humidity, and location data.

```
percentage, simple_text, text_output = predict_wildfire(0.75, 90, 50, location_var)
```
The function will return three values:
*The percentage likelihood of a wildfire.
*The simple text prediction, which is one of High, Medium, or Low.
*The detailed prediction generated by the GPT-3 architecture.
